# Breadboard Power Supply Module

A basic regulated power supply PCB designed for powering breadboard circuits with selectable 3.3V or 5V output.

## Features
- Designed in **KiCad 8**
- LM7805 voltage regulator (For 5V output)
- LM317 voltage regulator (For 3.3V output)
- Input via barrel jack
- Designed for direct insertion onto breadboard power rails
